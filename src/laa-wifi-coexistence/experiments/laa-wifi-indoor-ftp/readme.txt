For running the simulations, you should run the script run-laa-wifi-indoor-ftp.sh
You may configure the thresholds in the line  73. The distance d2 is also possible to set in the line 74.
You should set those values in the plot-laa-wifi-indoor-ftp.sh as well, which sould be ran just after the run script. This one will calculate the CDFs and generate the plots.
After that, you may run the specific gnuplot file to generate the adequate plot. The gnuplot files should be copied to the images/scripts directory and be ran from there.
